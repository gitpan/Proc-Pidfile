Revision history for Perl module Proc::Pidfile

1.05 2014-07-06 NEILB
    - The testsuite was trying to create files with 'Proc::Pidfile' in the
      name, which Windows didn't like. CPAN Testers++

1.04 2014-07-05 NEILB
    - Testsuite was still using Proc::ProcessTable, which meant that the
      change in 1.02 would result in failed tests if you didn't already
      have Proc::ProcessTable installed. Refactored testsuite.

1.03 2014-07-05 NEILB
    - Check whether operations on the pid file (read, write, lock, close)
      are successful, and croak if not.
      Thanks to John Tantalo for RT#67589.

1.02 2014-07-04 NEILB
    - Use kill(0,$pid) to check whether process is still running,
      rather than using Proc::ProcessTable. Apart from on RISC OS.
      DEPESZ++ for RT#56630.

1.01 2014-07-02 NEILB
    - Moved Pidfile.pm to lib/Proc/Pidfile.pm
    - Reformatted this file as per CPAN::Changes::Spec
